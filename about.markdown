<h4>Our Vision and Mission</h4>
<p class="mt-0">
<b>Vision</b> Our vision is to make Jesus a living presence in the lives of individuals, leading to a faith-filled and vibrant Church. We dream of witnessing a generation of joyful disciples who wholeheartedly say "YES" to the call of Jesus, actively transforming themselves, the Church, and society.

<b>Mission</b> Our mission is to create welcoming and prayerful spaces where people can encounter God and deepen their relationship with Him. We are committed to nurturing and discipling young adults and families, helping them discover their true identity as beloved children of the Most High God. By embracing this identity, we empower them to live holy lives and become passionate followers of Jesus. Additionally, we seek to equip and shape these young leaders, sending them forth to fulfill God's plan for their lives and positively impact the world around them.

<h4>Founders</h4>
<h5>Aires & Sandra</h5>
<img src="images/aires_sandra.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
<p class="mt-0">
<i>Married since 1998</i><br />
In 2005, Aires fell gravely ill and was on his deathbed. It was a terrifying time, and they found themselves at a crossroad between faith and paralyzing fear. They chose to have faith and surrendered wholeheartedly to God. God was merciful and Aires was miraculously healed. This experience left a profound impact on them, and they became even more convicted in their faith. As a result, they began to feel a need for Christ - as well as a call to bring Him to others and re-evangelize within the catholic church. They started by using that which brought them together: their love for music and started praise & worship sessions.In the course of time, together with like-minded individuals who they met along their journey, they formed a worship band called Kadosh. Their mission: To bring the love of Christ to others through music. They began performing at local churches and events, sharing their faith through song and inspiring others to join . Their journey has been one of faith, perseverance, and joy, and  are grateful for every opportunity to bring Christ to others.

    <h5>Dibin </h5>
    <p class="mb-0 mt-0">      
      Dibin is the drummer in our band. He started off with playing the cajon, and by listening to the silent voice in his heart, slowly learned how to play the drums and found his niche there, as that tuned out to be the language he uses to communicate with God.
      Dibin lives currently in Dresden and travels across to Hamburg whenever there is an option to worship God through his beats.
