  <h4>Our story</h4>
  <p>
    It was December 1998, and I came to Germany as a naïve young married woman with absolutely no idea of life or even married life. Coming from a rather conservative background and family to the freedoms of Europe was heady. We enjoyed life. On Sundays we went to church when we were able to. But in due course I found myself lonely and searching for something to fill that emptiness within me, that all the friends, parties and excitement of married life could not seem to fill. Health and issues with starting a family hounded my husband (Aires) and I during this period, but the moment that turned this story on its head was when Aires was lying in a hospital bed without the promise of seeing another day. I was indeed very fortunate to have had a close friend and family, who walked with us during those dark days and who kept showing us the hope and future to which God was calling us to. Dare we believe what they were saying? We were like lost ships in a storm but we also saw the lighthouse. We decided to trust God and His idea for our lives and began the slow journey of turning our boat to shore.  It has been a terrific journey so far, lots of trials and tribulations; but also great joy and happiness.  We decided to say yes to God´s call on our lives. And having experienced His great mercy and love, it is for us natural to want to extend this to all we meet.

    The moments of prayer and faith that followed were a new awakening for us to the presence and call of God in our lives.

    It was December 1998, and I found myself in a new country without anyone to speak to about my faith. There was no open celebration of the message of Christ. Having come from a very active Church community elsewhere, this left a void in me. I wanted to bring that spirit that I so loved to this, my new home and community. I started praying that God would do something to revive that joy I felt from being a part of his community.

    As time went by, the disconnection I felt was weighing on me. The strong flame of faith started to flicker but I would not let it go out. Health and issues with starting a family hounded my husband (Aires) and I during this period, but the moment that turned this story on its head was when Aires was lying in a hospital bed without the promise of seeing another day.

    The moments of prayer and faith that followed were a new awakening for us to the presence and call of God in our lives. A few months later, I had Aires and my faith in God back. What we experienced during those trying moments of Aires’ sickness were the corner blocks of what we have today. 
    It was then that our mission in Christ started…and we never looked back.
