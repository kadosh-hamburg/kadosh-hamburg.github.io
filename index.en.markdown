   Welcome to Kadosh. We are a dedicated Catholic spiritual community serving within the Archdiocese of Hamburg. At Kadosh we combined our deep-rooted passion for Jesus, his Church, and his Word with our profound love for music. We find immense fulfillment and gratitude in every opportunity we have to share the message of Christ with others and strive to make a positive impact in the lives of those we encounter. Our journey is one of faith, perseverance, and joy. Whether you are seeking a place to deepen your faith, connect with fellow believers, or simply find solace and inspiration, we are here to welcome you with open arms. Within our community, individuals from all walks of life come together to worship, learn, and grow spiritually. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about us.
